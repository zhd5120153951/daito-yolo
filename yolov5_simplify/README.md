Thx for the origin YOLOv5 project from: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

This project is just the simpliication of the yolov5 with:
  1. Only support Pytorch
  2. Only contain inference but not training stage
  3. No additional operations support (eg. save results, visualize features, ...) 
  4. Weights can be downloaded from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases
